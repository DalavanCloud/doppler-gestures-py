# Python Doppler Gestures

# Usage

```
$ ./doppler-gestures.py <tone> <window>
```

__tone__ is in Hz  
__window__ is in hz

Working example:

```
$ PYTHONPATH=.  
$ ./doppler-gestures.py 20000 500
```

Your speakers should be on rather high (no headphones) and your input/mic should also be on and at a high input gain.
